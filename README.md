# Daowakanda Dev Task

This dev task requires you to call the 'claimAsset' method of a smart contract using the Application Spec in `src/client.ts`;
For reference, see this example: https://github.com/Algorand-Africa/peer-coding-session-1/blob/main/client/src/index.ts

In order to sucessfully call the 'claimAsset' method, you must pass a minimum fee of 6000 micro algos to the transaction.

To complete this dev task, you must create a fork of the repository and commit your answer. A link to your fork should be
submitted on DaoWakanda.
